We focused on creating reusable components, optimizing performance, and ensuring smooth navigation to deliver a polished and intuitive experience. The project further strengthened my leadership skills as I guided my team through problem-solving, debugging, and improving overall efficiency. This experience reinforced my ability to adapt to challenges, think creatively under constraints, and execute projects effectively even with limited resources. It also deepened my expertise in mobile app development and taught me the importance of balancing design, development, and team management to deliver high-quality applications."
