With this expanded team, we not only enhanced and optimized the Singularity App but also started working on multiple other app development projects. The transition from being an individual contributor to a team leader was both challenging and rewarding, as I learned to mentor developers, manage workflows, and oversee project execution efficiently. This experience refined my ability to design scalable UI components, improve application performance, and collaborate across teams. More importantly, it solidified my expertise in React Native, making me confident in handling mobile app development from the ground up. Singularity App was more than just a project—it was the stepping stone that helped me grow into a full-fledged app developer and leader."
